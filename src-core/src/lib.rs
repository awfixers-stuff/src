//! The purpose of this crate is to abstract the user interface of `src` (the command-line interface) from the actual implementation.
//! That way, one day it's possible to provide alternative frontends, including user interfaces.
//!
//! ### What is `src`?
//!
//! `src` is a tool to aid developers of `gitoxide` run their code in real-world situations and to validate the `src` API.
//! This makes it more of a test-bed than a tool that could ever rival `git` in terms of feature-set.
//!
//! That said, `src` may actively carve out a niche for itself where it sees the greatest benefits for users of `git`.
//!
//! ### This crate is internal - use `src` instead.
//!
//! It's important to understand that this crate consider itself an implementation detail of the `src` CLI and is not meant to be
//! used for external consumption by means of `cargo` dependency. This is emphasized by there being no other documentation.
//! There is also no intention of ever stabilizing this crate.
//!
//! If you want to get started with what powers `src`, please take a look at the `src` crate which provides all the building
//! blocks to create any application, including a carbon-copy of `git` itself (at least aspirationally as not all capabilities are
//! available in `src` yet).
//!
//! For users of `src`, this codebase might serve as elaborate example as most of not all of its APIs are used here.
//!
